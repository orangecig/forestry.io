This doc will walk you through:

1. Setting up your site repository with Forestry
2. Making your first commit by publishing some changes

---

## Import Site from Repo

[Sign up](https://app.forestry.io/signup/) for a free account with Forestry.io then add a new site from your [dashboard](https://app.forestry.io/dashboard).

If you **don't** have a Jekyll or Hugo site, click the link in the bottom of the _setup window_ to launch the demo site.

### Select your Static Site Generator

Before choosing your repository, Forestry needs to know which static site generator is used to build your site. Forestry supports both [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/). In the case of Hugo, you must also specify which _version_ you use.

### Select your Git Provider

Forestry works by synchronize content changes with a git repository. In order to import your site, access to your git provider are required. There are currently three Git providers supported by Forestry: [GitHub](https://github.com/ "GitHub"), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/ "GitLab"), and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/ "Bitbucket").

### Choose a Repository and Branch

Once the authorization is complete, you will be taken to the next screen where you can choose the repository you wish to import.

{{% warning "GitHub Repository Permissions" %}}  
In order to watch for changes from Github, Forestry needs to be able to create a webhook for your repository. Because of this, you must have admin level permissions for any repository you wish to import. Repositories which you do not have admin access to will be visible in the dropdown, but cannot be selected.  
{{% /warning %}}

If you use Github, you will see a button at the top of the modal with a lock. By default, Forestry only requests access to your public repositories. Click this button if you wan to grant access to Forestry to import your private repositories. You will only have to do this once.

{{% warning "Config file in sub Folder" %}}  
Forestry may ask you to provide the path to your Jekyll or Hugo config file, if it cannot be found in the root of your project.  
{{% /warning %}}

Once you have chosen your repository and the config file for your site has been found, click the **Import Site** button. After a few moments you will be redirected into the Forestry CMS while the site finishes importing. Depending on the size of your site, the import process can take a few minutes. Stretch your legs, grab a glass of water, and it will be done before you know it.

## Document State

Go into a post or page, **edit some text** and you will see "Unsaved Changes" at the top of your document.

The page should become **up-to-date** with your repository again.

Go to your Git repo and look at your commit history. You should see your updates from Forestry there. Committing has never been easier!
